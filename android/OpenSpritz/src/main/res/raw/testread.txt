Molecularly targeted therapeutics have failed to improve prognosis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Targeting KRAS, a frequently mutated driver of PDAC tumors, has been unsuccessful, rationalizing the use of inhibitors against its downstream targets (MEK1/2) and upstream regulators (EGFR/HER2). Our group previously demonstrated that lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, enhanced the anti-tumor activity of trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of PDAC. Here, we analyzed the transcriptional responses to these drugs alone and in combination across three PDAC PDX tumor lines and found that inhibiting EGFR/HER2 enhanced gene expression changes induced by MEK1/2 inhibition. We also identified synergistic changes in gene expression for one tumor line and demonstrated that MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in activation of AKT-mediated transcription that was suppressed by inhibiting EGFR/HER2. These results demonstrated that targeting components both upstream and downstream of KRAS signaling additively disrupted canonical EGFR-KRAS-MEK-ERK signaling but could also synergistically prevent activation of compensatory signaling, providing a mechanistic understanding of how lapatinib and trametinib might work together to reduce growth in PDAC.
